1.07 neilb 03-jul-2002

	We now over-ride the getopt() method, and handle the
	standard options if getopt() is used rather than args().
	Change based on a patch from Martin Bloecker.

	Added a set of tests which exercise the getopt() method.

	Renamed the show_version() function to _show_version(),
	to signify its private status.


1.06 neilb 09-mar-2002

	The testsuite was try to invoke perl on the test script,
	which fails if you install the binary as something other
	than "perl". Changed "perl" to "$^X". Also invoked perl
	with -Iblib/lib when running the test, so that it actually
	pulls in the version you think you're testing :-)
	Thanks to Ed Santiago for both of these.


1.05 neilb 19-jan-2002

	Added a basic test-suite. Tests all switches apart
	from -help. The test-suite works by comparing the
	output of a test script with expected output.
	The output of -help will be formatted slightly
	differently on different systems (pod2usage() uses
	perldoc to format the output), so the comparison
	is likely to fail.

1.04 neilb 15-jan-2002

	Updated call to pod2usage() - the API has changed.

	Minor improvements to documentation.

1.03 neilb 26-feb-2001

	Tied up the documentation; eg updated references to CPAN.

	Added a -verbose switch - found I was adding one of these
	to just about all of my scripts.

1.02 neilb 09-december-1998

	First version of module. Created from previous module App::StdConfig.
