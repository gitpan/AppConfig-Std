1.5 neilb 19-jan-2002

	Added a basic test-suite. Tests all switches apart
	from -help. The test-suite works by comparing the
	output of a test script with expected output.
	The output of -help will be formatted slightly
	differently on different systems (pod2usage() uses
	perldoc to format the output), so the comparison
	is likely to fail.

1.4 neilb 15-jan-2002

	Updated call to pod2usage() - the API has changed.

	Minor improvements to documentation.

1.3 neilb 26-feb-2001

	Tied up the documentation; eg updated references to CPAN.

	Added a -verbose switch - found I was adding one of these
	to just about all of my scripts.

1.2 neilb 09-december-1998

	First version of module. Created from previous module App::StdConfig.
